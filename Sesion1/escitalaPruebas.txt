THE PRELUDE




ON FEAR AND ARISTOCRACY



1

The
 story of William Porphyry Benham is the story of a 
man who was led
into adventure by an idea. It was an
 idea that took possession of his
imagination quite 
early in life, it grew with him and changed with him
,
it interwove at last completely with his being. Hi
s story is its story.
It was traceably germinating i
n the schoolboy; it was manifestly present
in his mi
nd at the very last moment of his adventurous life. 
He belonged
to that fortunate minority who are indep
endent of daily necessities, so
that he was free to 
go about the world under its direction. It led him
f
ar. It led him into situations that bordered upon th
e fantastic, it
made him ridiculous, it came near to
 making him sublime. And this idea
of his was of suc
h a nature that in several aspects he could document

it. Its logic forced him to introspection and to th
e making of a record.

An idea that can play so larg
e a part in a life must necessarily have
something o
f the complication and protean quality of life itsel
f. It is
not to be stated justly in any formula, it 
is not to be rendered by an
epigram. As well one mig
ht show a man's skeleton for his portrait. Yet,
esse
ntially, Benham's idea was simple. He had an incurab
le, an almost
innate persuasion that he had to live 
life nobly and thoroughly. His
commoner expression f
or that thorough living is “the aristocratic life.”

 But by “aristocratic” he meant something very diffe
rent from the
quality of a Russian prince, let us sa
y, or an English peer. He meant an
intensity, a clea
rness.... Nobility for him was to get something out 
of
his individual existence, a flame, a jewel, a spl
endour--it is a thing
easier to understand than to s
ay.

One might hesitate to call this idea “innate,” 
and yet it comes soon
into a life when it comes at a
ll. In Benham's case we might trace it
back to the D
ay Nursery at Seagate, we might detect it stirring a
lready
at the petticoat stage, in various private st
ruttings and valiant
dreamings with a helmet of past
eboard and a white-metal sword. We have
most of us b
een at least as far as that with Benham. And we have

died like Horatius, slaying our thousands for our c
ountry, or we have
perished at the stake or faced th
e levelled muskets of the firing
party--“No, do not 
bandage my eyes”--because we would not betray the
se
cret path that meant destruction to our city. But wi
th Benham the
vein was stronger, and it increased in
stead of fading out as he grew
to manhood. It was le
ss obscured by those earthy acquiescences, those
dis
cretions, that saving sense of proportion, which hav
e made most of
us so satisfactorily what we are. “Po
rphyry,” his mother had discovered
before he was sev
enteen, “is an excellent boy, a brilliant boy, but, 
I
begin to see, just a little unbalanced.”

The inte
rest of him, the absurdity of him, the story of him,
 is that.

Most of us are--balanced; in spite of occ
asional reveries we do come to
terms with the limita
tions of life, with those desires and dreams and
dis
cretions that, to say the least of it, qualify our n
obility, we take
refuge in our sense of humour and c
ongratulate ourselves on a certain
amiable freedom f
rom priggishness or presumption, but for Benham that

easy declension to a humorous acceptance of life as
 it is did not occur.
He found his limitations soon 
enough; he was perpetually
rediscovering them, but o
ut of these interments of the spirit he rose
again--
remarkably. When we others have decided that, to be 
plain about
it, we are not going to lead the noble l
ife at all, that the thing is
too ambitious and expe
nsive even to attempt, we have done so because
there
 were other conceptions of existence that were good 
enough for us,
we decided that instead of that glori
ous impossible being of ourselves,
we would figure i
n our own eyes as jolly fellows, or sly dogs, or san
e,
sound, capable men or brilliant successes, and so
 forth--practicable
things. For Benham, exceptionall
y, there were not these practicable
things. He blund
ered, he fell short of himself, he had--as you will

be told--some astonishing rebuffs, but they never tu
rned him aside for
long. He went by nature for this 
preposterous idea of nobility as a
linnet hatched in
 a cage will try to fly.

And when he discovered--an
d in this he was assisted not a little by his
friend
 at his elbow--when he discovered that Nobility was 
not the simple
thing he had at first supposed it to 
be, he set himself in a mood only
slightly disconcer
ted to the discovery of Nobility. When it dawned upo
n
him, as it did, that one cannot be noble, so to sp
eak, IN VACUO, he set
himself to discover a Noble So
ciety. He began with simple beliefs and
fine attitud
es and ended in a conscious research. If he could no
t get
through by a stride, then it followed that he 
must get through by a
climb. He spent the greater pa
rt of his life studying and experimenting
in the nob
le possibilities of man. He never lost his absurd fa
ith in
that conceivable splendour. At first it was a
lways just round the corner
or just through the wood
; to the last it seemed still but a little way
beyon
d the distant mountains.

For this reason this story
 has been called THE RESEARCH MAGNIFICENT. It
was a 
real research, it was documented. In the rooms in We
sthaven Street
that at last were as much as one coul
d call his home, he had accumulated
material for--on
e hesitates to call it a book--let us say it was an

analysis of, a guide to the noble life. There after 
his tragic death
came his old friend White, the jour
nalist and novelist, under a promise,
and found thes
e papers; he found them to the extent of a crammed
b
ureau, half a score of patent files quite distended 
and a writing-table
drawer-full, and he was greatly 
exercised to find them. They were,
White declares, t
hey are still after much experienced handling, an
in
digestible aggregation. On this point White is very 
assured. When
Benham thought he was gathering togeth
er a book he was dreaming, White
says. There is no b
ook in it....

Perhaps too, one might hazard, Benham
 was dreaming when he thought the
noble life a human
 possibility. Perhaps man, like the ape and the hyae
na
and the tapeworm and many other of God's necessar
y but less attractive
creatures, is not for such exa
lted ends. That doubt never seems to have
got a lodg
ment in Benham's skull; though at times one might su
ppose it
the basis of White's thought. You will find
 in all Benham's story,
if only it can be properly t
old, now subdued, now loud and amazed and
distressed
, but always traceable, this startled, protesting qu
estion,
“BUT WHY THE DEVIL AREN'T WE?” As though nec
essarily we ought to be.
He never faltered in his pe
rsuasion that behind the dingy face of this
world, t
he earthy stubbornness, the baseness and dulness of 
himself
and all of us, lurked the living jewels of h
eaven, the light of glory,
things unspeakable. At fi
rst it seemed to him that one had only just to
hamme
r and will, and at the end, after a life of willing 
and hammering,
he was still convinced there was some
thing, something in the nature of
an Open Sesame, pe
rhaps a little more intricate than one had supposed

at first, a little more difficult to secure, but sti
ll in that nature,
which would suddenly roll open fo
r mankind the magic cave of the
universe, that preci
ous cave at the heart of all things, in which one
mu
st believe.

And then life--life would be the wonder
 it so perplexingly just
isn't....

Benham did
 not go about the world telling people of this consu
ming
research. He was not the prophet or preacher of
 his idea. It was too
living and intricate and uncer
tain a part of him to speak freely about.
It was his
 secret self; to expose it casually would have shame
d him. He
drew all sorts of reserves about him, he w
ore his manifest imperfections
turned up about him l
ike an overcoat in bitter wind. He was content
to be
 inexplicable. His thoughts led him to the convictio
n that this
magnificent research could not be, any m
ore than any other research
can be, a solitary enter
prise, but he delayed expression; in a mighty
writin
g and stowing away of these papers he found a relief
 from the
unpleasant urgency to confess and explain 
himself prematurely. So that
White, though he knew B
enham with the intimacy of an old schoolfellow
who h
ad renewed his friendship, and had shared his last d
ays and been a
witness of his death, read the sheets
 of manuscript often with surprise
and with a sense 
of added elucidation.

And, being also a trained mak
er of books, White as he read was more
and more dist
ressed that an accumulation so interesting should be
 so
entirely unshaped for publication. “But this wil
l never make a book,”
 said White with a note of per
sonal grievance. His hasty promise in their
last mom
ents together had bound him, it seemed, to a task he
 now found
impossible. He would have to work upon it
 tremendously; and even then he
did not see how it c
ould be done.
